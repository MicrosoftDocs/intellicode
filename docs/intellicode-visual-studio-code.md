# IntelliCode extension for Visual Studio Code

You can [download an experimental extension](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2006060) for Visual Studio Code version 1.25.1 and higher.

This extension currently provides AI-enhanced IntelliSense for Python that predicts the most likely correct API for the developer to use, rather than just presenting an alphabetical list of members. It uses the developer's current code context and patterns to provide this dynamic list.

We'll update the extension with more capabilities in the coming months.
