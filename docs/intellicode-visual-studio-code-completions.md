# IntelliCode Completions Preview for Visual Studio Code

The [IntelliCode Completions extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode-completions) is an experimental extension which predicts up to a whole line of code based on your current code context.

This extension may contain unstable, experimental code. The IntelliCode team is focused on iterating rapidly and new functionality will be added.

## How to use

Completions will appear after your cursor as you type, with a faded color. When the IntelliSense list is open, its selection is used to inform the whole-line autocompletion.

At any time you can accept the suggestion by pressing the tab key (you will need to press it twice if the IntelliSense list is visible). If you don't want to accept the suggestion, you can just keep on typing or press ESC.

### Snippet Completion

![Accepting a grey text completion with empty string automatically moves the cursor to the empty string](media/vsc-wlc-snippetcompletion.gif)

If the whole-line autocompletion includes empty strings:

1. The cursor will automatically move to the first empty string upon accepting the prediction with the TAB key.
2. If further empty strings exist within the prediction, pressing the TAB key again will automatically move the cursor to the next empty string.

### Enabling JavaScript/TypeScript Support

To enable experimental support for JavaScript and TypeScript, search for `intellicodeCompletions.language` in the Settings menu.

## Installation

The extension can be aquired at the following link: [IntelliCode Completions extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode-completions)

The extension is supported by Visual Studio Code November 2021 Release 1.63 or later.
