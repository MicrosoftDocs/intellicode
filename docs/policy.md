# Global Policy opt-out management for sending personal data to IntelliCode services from Visual Studio

> Applies to Visual Studio 2019 16.8 and newer

Learn how to use group policy to manage your organization's usage of IntelliCode capabilites in Visual Studio. First,
we'll describe what IntelliCode policy settings are available. Then we'll walk
through how to opt-out your organization.

## Prerequisites

The following items are required for applying group policy for IntelliCode capabilities:

- A Visual Studio Admin role.

Visual Studio IntelliCode is a suite of AI-assisted developer tools that uses machine learning to improve the inner loop developer experience in Visual Studio. Some IntelliCode capabilities require sending personal data from Visual Studio to the IntelliCode service: {e.g. Team Completions} IntelliCode [collects information about your types and type usage](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/intellicode/custom-models#data-and-privacy), computer hardware, and repository information and sends to the IntelliCode service over an HTTPS connection, without interrupting users in their tasks at the computer. The information that's collected allows IntelliCode to securely train and distribute personalized models. This document covers how to opt in or out of using IntelliCode service-backed capabilities.

## User-level Opt in or out in Visual Studio
All released IntelliCode capabilities are turned **on** by default, and all Preview IntelliCode capabilities are turned **off** by default. Users can turn capabilities off, or back on again, by following these instructions:

1. In Visual Studio, go to **Tools** > **Options** > **IntelliCode**.
1. To explicitly opt out, select **Disabled** for the respective capability. To opt in, select **Enabled** for the respective capability.


### Registry settings for Global Policy opt-out

Enterprise customers can construct a group policy to opt in or out of IntelliCode Service-backed capabilities by setting a registry-based policy.

The relevant registry key and settings are as follows:

::: moniker range=">=vs-2019"
- On a 64-bit OS, Key = **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\VSCommon\16.0\IntelliCode**
- On a 32-bit OS, Key = **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VSCommon\16.0\IntelliCode**
- When Group Policy is enabled, Key = **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\VisualStudio\IntelliCode**
::: moniker-end

Entry = **OptIn**

Value = (DWORD)

- **0** is opted out (turn off organizational access to IntelliCode Service-backed capabilities)
- **1** is opted in (turn on organizational access to IntelliCode Service-backed capabilities)

> [!CAUTION]
> Incorrectly editing the registry may severely damage your system. Before making changes to the registry, you should back up any valued data on the computer. You can also use the **Last Known Good Configuration** startup option if you encounter problems after manual changes have been applied.
